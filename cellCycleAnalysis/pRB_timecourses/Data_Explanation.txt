Plotting the percent of p-Rb positive cells over time in MLC2v positive cells (green), MLC2v negative cells (red) and all cells (blue)
Gating was done by grouping all DMSO data together and performing k-means clustering with k=2
Histograms for total population of pRb and MLC2v data are provided, gate set by clustering were at 10.4 for pRb and 11.55 for MLC2v 
Individual plots are shown for treatment (Sorafenib and DMSO) as well as dose and antibody panel
